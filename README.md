# Davesbodyshopform

Problem: The Form present on the contact us page of the davesbodyshopstpt.com website at the time of this case study was not user friendly and confusing to use. 

Solution: To show what Iâ€™ve learned about providing a positive user experience to a web form, I created a new form addressing the various issues.
